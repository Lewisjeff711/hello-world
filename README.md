# hello-world
I'm ready to enter the New World.
My name is Jeff, and I want to get to understand the Art and Science of Software Development.
This won't be easy.
My hope is that working with this Site, I will catch onto, and hopefully contribute something, albeit with some extreme effort on my part.
